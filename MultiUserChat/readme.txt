This is the MultiUserChat program, which allows users to login, logout, and send messages to eachother.

Required for this project is:

import org.apache.commons.lang3.StringUtils;

This import will allow the required string manipulation in some of the code.
To operate the program, first run ServerMain.java, then UserListPane.java
Connect with telnet: "telnet localhost 8818"
use two terminal instances to login as both users using "login jim jim" and "login guest guest"
click on the other user's name in the UserListPane to open a MessagePane
type your message in the box at the bottom of the MessagePane and hit enter to send it.
